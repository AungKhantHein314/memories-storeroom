 Memories Storing Site
</h1>

A project that stores **memories (memos)** of users. Each post contains data such as -
- Creator
- Title
- Message
- Tags
- Date
- Image

>> This project is from a tutorial on YouTube. But I tried my best to follow and understand the *process and codes*. This site is still **under development.**
